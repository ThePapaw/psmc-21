The [B]<reuselanguageinvoker>[/B] element is a feature introduced with PSMC 18.0 that changes the way
the python invoker works in PSMC trying to reuse the invoker instances as much as possible. As a
result, the addon performance is greatly improved. Please note that instability issues may occur
due to reported bugs in this new implementation.  Test on your own!!!
